you can also set `teamId` and `apiUrl` `.turbo/config.json` in the root of your project.

## Todo

- [ ] Support turbo headers `x-artifact-duration`, `x-artifact-tag`, `x-artifact-client-ci` and `x-artifact-client-interactive` right now those are ignored and they don't affect the cache.
- [ ] Add nx cloud support.
- [ ] Publish docker images.
- [ ] Add more advanced authentication support.
- [ ] Maybe having a dashboard to manage teams and projects would be nice.
